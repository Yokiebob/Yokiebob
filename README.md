I am a small developer that develops things for fun and education.

Programming things I'm interested in: Ray/(tracing,marching,casting), wasm, webgl2, webgpu, emulation, game development, cryptography, prime numbers, 2d games, 3d games, fractals, C/C++, javascript, asm, linux, how computer hardware is made, etc...
Hopefully I can do one of them good.
